# CU Boulder letter template

This contains two source formats

* [LaTeX](./latex)
* [Typst](./typst)

See the subdirectories for detail specific to these.

## Fonts

[Nimbus Sans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nimbus_Sans) is an open derivative
of Helvetica, which is
[recommended](https://www.colorado.edu/brand/how-use/typography) for text
related to CU branding. I strongly recommend keeping it at least for the heading
text.

I'm also using Nimbus Sans for the body, but you can choose a serif (such as [TeX Gyre
Pagella](http://www.gust.org.pl/projects/e-foundry/tex-gyre), a free Palatino extension).
